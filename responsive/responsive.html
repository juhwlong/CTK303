      <h1>Elmo Rules the World</h1>
      <p>One day Elmo went on Twitter and asked the world how they were doing and the world responded with some of the funniest and also most concerning tweets. Elmo then tweeted about the suicide prevention number because he had opened a jar that he could not close again.</p>

      <p class="float">Growing up I was a very big fan of Elmo and i guess more specifically his little fish. But I hated that mime through his door? Window? Either way I hated him so much. Annoying, pretentious.</p>
      <p>Elmo is a furry red Muppet character on the children's television show Sesame Street. He is self-described as 3-and-a-half years old, and his age is a running gag. Elmo characterizes a preschooler with a positive attitude and curious nature. He always refers to himself in the third person, and Elmo's World is a 15-minute-long segment shown at the end of the American children's television program Sesame Street.</p>
